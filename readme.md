# Layers

Photoshop-like layering tool for building Roblox games.

# Features
Functionality is very similar to layering in most image editing software.
- Each layer can be hidden and locked.
- You can move parts between layers.
- You can select every part within a given layer.

The plugin also adds a [PluginAction](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/PluginAction) for creating folders. To set up a keybind, go to File -> Advanced -> Customize Shortcuts, and search "make folder".

# Workflows
Using Sweetheartichoke's [Tag Editor plugin](https://www.roblox.com/library/948084095/Tag-Editor) makes it easier to distinguish between layers in the workspace.

The "Select All" tool combined with the _make folder_ PluginAction makes it easy to organize your workspace. Select Layer -> Select All -> make folder keybind -> rename -> repeat.
